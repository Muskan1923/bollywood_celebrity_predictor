# üé¨ Bollywood Celebrity Predictor  

A *Deep Learning and Computer Vision project* that predicts *which Bollywood celebrity you resemble the most*.  
This project combines *face detection, **feature extraction, and **similarity matching* techniques to deliver accurate and fun results.  

Built with *TensorFlow/Keras, **VGGFace (ResNet50), **MTCNN, **OpenCV, and a **Streamlit UI*, this project demonstrates how pre-trained models can be applied to solve real-world face recognition tasks.

## ‚ú® Project Overview  

Have you ever wondered which Bollywood celebrity you look like?  
This project allows you to upload your picture, detects your face, extracts facial embeddings using *VGGFace*, and then compares them with embeddings of Bollywood celebrity images stored in the dataset.  

The closest match is returned along with the celebrity's image.  

üîë *Key Concepts Used*:  
- *Face Detection: Using **MTCNN* to locate the face in an image.  
- *Feature Extraction: Using **VGGFace (ResNet50)* without the top layer, trained on large face datasets.  
- *Cosine Similarity*: Measuring similarity between extracted embeddings and stored celebrity embeddings.  
- *Interactive App: Built with **Streamlit* for a user-friendly interface.
